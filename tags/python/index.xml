      <description>Why is this significant? Python is a widely-used coding language employed for a variety of purposes in computer science. In my Computational Biology class, we used Python and R in very similar ways, and in doing so learned how the two languages may be able to accomplish similar end goals, but they still each have certain strengths over the other.
These respective strengths and weaknesses across different tasks in both languages may be a cause for concern when it comes to certain projects.</description>
